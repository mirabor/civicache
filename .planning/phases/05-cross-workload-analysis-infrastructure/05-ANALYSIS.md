# Phase 5 Analysis Notes — Why the Numbers Look The Way They Do

This document is the *interpretive* companion to Phase 5's raw-numbers tables
(`workload_characterization.md`, `winner_per_regime.md`). The tables say **what**
wins. This document says **why** — connecting workload characteristics to policy
mechanisms and flagging where the numbers contradict conventional wisdom.

It's the raw material for the paper's analysis section (DOC-02).

## Headline Finding

**W-TinyLFU dominates the miss-ratio dimension in 11 of 12 cells (6 cache-fractions × 2 workloads).**
SIEVE is the only other winner, and only at one Congress cell (cache_frac=0.020).
This validates the literature's claim that TinyLFU-flavor admission beats pure
recency-based eviction on realistic skewed access patterns.

But the full story is more interesting than "W-TinyLFU wins." Three sub-findings
matter for the paper:

1. **On Congress, SIEVE and W-TinyLFU are statistically tied at high α.** The
   regime table's "Congress High Skew → SIEVE" is a photo-finish: gaps < 1σ.
2. **On Court, W-TinyLFU wins by a consistent 4-5pp across every α.** The gap is
   stable — not a photo-finish.
3. **Court's byte-miss-ratio is dominated by a single 462KB outlier object** — a
   1,984× multiple of the median document size. Whether that object survives in
   cache is a coin-flip on the Zipf seed, producing σ=0.21 in byte-miss across
   the 5 seeds (vs σ≤0.01 on object miss-ratio for most cells).

These three findings are the paper's "why do these policies win?" story.

## Workload Characterization — The Numbers, Re-Interpreted

| Metric              | Congress                 | Court                    | What it means |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Raw α (MLE)         | 0.231                    | 1.028                    | Congress raw trace is *near-uniform* (almost no skew); Court raw trace is genuinely heavy-tailed |
| OHW ratio (10% win) | 0.989                    | 1.000                    | Both workloads are overwhelmingly one-hit-wonders in the raw trace — the canonical admission-filter regime |
| Unique / total      | 18,970 / 20,692 = 91.7%  | 15,018 / 20,000 = 75.1%  | Congress is basically "new key every request"; Court has more repetition |
| Median obj size     | 231 B                    | 1,381 B                  | Court documents are ~6× bigger than Congress JSON responses |
| p95 / median ratio  | 2,698 / 231 = 11.7×      | 6,221 / 1,381 = 4.5×     | Congress has a longer size tail *proportionally* |
| Max / median ratio  | 6,700 / 231 = 29×        | 462,490 / 1,381 = 335×   | **Court has a catastrophic size outlier — one document is 335× the median** |
| Working set bytes   | 14.5 MB                  | 59.6 MB                  | Court's raw corpus is ~4× larger by bytes; ~20% fewer unique keys |

**Why the raw α differs so much:**
- Congress.gov API calls are *client-generated random queries* — no user
  naturally re-requests bill #1234 after requesting bill #5678. α=0.23 matches
  "essentially uniform random over the key space."
- CourtListener's REST v4 serves *judicial documents* — opinions get cited in
  briefs, dockets get refreshed during active cases, the same cluster-ID
  appears across multiple search results. There's real structural locality that
  survives in the trace.

**Why we still run replay-Zipf on both:** the raw traces are both OHW-dominated
(0.989 / 1.000), so neither gives meaningful policy-comparison results without a
popularity overlay. Replay-Zipf preserves the real *key* and *size* distributions
while imposing a controlled α sweep on *which* keys get repeated. This is what
makes cross-workload comparison well-posed.

## Why W-TinyLFU Wins 11/12 MRC Cells

W-TinyLFU is the only policy in our set that has **explicit frequency tracking**.
Specifically:

- A 4-bit Count-Min Sketch counts approximate per-key access frequency
- New candidates must out-frequency the current victim to be admitted to main
- Small 1% window LRU gives one-hit wonders a chance to prove recurrence
- CMS halving every N ops keeps frequency estimates adapted to changing hotness

**Why this dominates:** every other policy we tested (LRU, FIFO, CLOCK, S3-FIFO,
SIEVE) uses only *recency* signals. Under Zipf with high α, a key's long-run
frequency is a better predictor of its next-access probability than its most
recent access time — and only W-TinyLFU's CMS tracks that directly.

**Where the win is largest:** Small Cache (cache_frac=0.001) on Court — W-TinyLFU
beats LRU by 12.9pp (0.831 vs 0.960). The intuition: when the cache holds ~10
objects out of a 15K-unique-key workload, every admission is life-or-death. A
wrong admission (one-hit wonder) forever evicts a repeat-access key. TinyLFU's
admission filter is literally the thing preventing this disaster.

**Where the win is smallest:** large caches on Congress (cache_frac=0.1), where
~1,900 objects fit and the cache is big enough to absorb nearly all the hot set
regardless of eviction policy. Here the WTLFU-vs-LRU gap shrinks to ~5pp.

---

## Why SIEVE Ties W-TinyLFU on Congress (and Loses on Court)

This is the most interesting finding Phase 5 produced, and it contradicts the
"W-TinyLFU dominates on skewed traces" narrative of the TinyLFU paper.

### The data

**Congress alpha-sweep — W-TinyLFU vs SIEVE gap** (negative = SIEVE wins):
```
  α=0.6: +0.0020    α=0.9: -0.0004
  α=0.7: -0.0002    α=1.0: -0.0047  ← SIEVE wins
  α=0.8: +0.0014    α=1.1: -0.0019  ← SIEVE wins
                    α=1.2: -0.0016  ← SIEVE wins
```
Gap is always within ±0.005 — less than 1σ. **These two policies are tied on Congress.**

**Court alpha-sweep — same gap:**
```
  α=0.6: +0.0418    α=1.0: +0.0469
  α=0.7: +0.0492    α=1.1: +0.0393
  α=0.8: +0.0543    α=1.2: +0.0359
  α=0.9: +0.0540
```
Gap is stable at ~4-5pp across every α. **W-TinyLFU decisively wins on Court.**

### Hypothesized mechanism

SIEVE's "visited-bit" eviction is a poor-man's admission filter in disguise:

- On a miss, the new key enters the cache with `visited=false`
- On a hit, the key's bit flips to `true`
- Eviction scans a pointer forward, clearing `visited=true` bits and skipping,
  evicting the first `visited=false` key it hits

**Effectively, SIEVE evicts one-hit wonders aggressively.** A key that was
inserted but never re-accessed is the primary eviction target. That's a
mechanism *functionally similar* to TinyLFU's "admit only if frequency >= victim"
— just discovered through a different implementation path.

**On Congress (α_raw=0.231, uniform sizes, 91.7% unique keys):** The raw trace
gives almost no frequency signal. W-TinyLFU's CMS sees essentially-all-ones
counters (most keys seen once or twice). The admission filter becomes close to
a no-op. Meanwhile SIEVE's visited-bit is equally effective at rejecting
one-hit-wonders after one cache-cycle. The two policies converge.

**On Court (α_raw=1.028, long-tail sizes, real locality):** The raw trace
has real structure. W-TinyLFU's CMS captures a *gradient* of frequencies — key
A has been seen 5 times, B has been seen 2 times, C once. The admission filter
preserves hot keys decisively. SIEVE's *binary* visited-bit loses this gradient:
a key seen once and a key seen fifty times are indistinguishable to the scanner.
Hence W-TinyLFU pulls ahead by ~5pp.

### The paper claim

> "The value of W-TinyLFU's admission filter depends on whether the workload has
> a usable frequency gradient above what SIEVE's visited-bit already captures.
> On workloads with limited real locality (Congress), SIEVE's visited-bit is
> near-equivalent. On workloads with strong real locality (Court), W-TinyLFU's
> frequency tracking captures information SIEVE's binary signal misses."

This is a more nuanced finding than the TinyLFU paper's "W-TinyLFU wins on Zipf"
— which implicitly assumes Zipf is the whole story. Our data shows raw trace
structure matters *independently* of the α overlay.

### Open question for the paper

**Does the ordering invert on Congress at even higher α (1.3, 1.4)?** Our alpha
grid stops at 1.2 (matching Phase 2's sweep grid). If SIEVE were to fall behind
W-TinyLFU at α=1.5+ on Congress, that would be the exact cross-over point
predicted by the mechanism: as α rises, the replay-Zipf popularity overlay
generates enough frequency gradient to overcome Congress's weak raw structure.
**Recommended v2 extension: run α ∈ {1.3, 1.4, 1.5} on Congress to test this.**

## Why Court's Byte-Miss-Ratio Has σ=0.21 Across Seeds

### The data

At cache_frac=0.01 on Court:

| Policy      | Object miss-ratio (5-seed mean ± σ) | Byte miss-ratio (5-seed mean ± σ) |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| W-TinyLFU   | 0.728 ± 0.045                        | **0.611 ± 0.207**                  |
| SIEVE       | 0.783 ± 0.045                        | 0.656 ± 0.205                      |
| LRU         | 0.847 ± 0.026                        | 0.755 ± 0.171                      |

Object-miss σ is normal (0.03-0.05). **Byte-miss σ is 4-7× larger** — every
policy's byte-miss swings by 20+ pp across seeds.

### The mechanism

Court's max object size is **462,490 bytes** — a single monster document in a
corpus whose median is 1,381 B. That one outlier represents:

- 0.78% of the working set by bytes (462KB / 59.6MB)
- 0.007% of the objects (1 / 15,018)

When cache_frac=0.01 and working_set=59.6MB, the cache is ~600KB. **That single
outlier is 77% of the cache.** Whether it lives in cache for most of the trace
is a near-binary signal on byte-miss-ratio.

The replay-Zipf seed controls which key gets the highest popularity rank. If
seed assigns the outlier to rank-1 (highest popularity), it stays cached → low
byte-miss. If seed assigns it to rank-10000+, it never enters cache → high
byte-miss. No eviction policy can fix this — it's a popularity-assignment
artifact.

### The paper claim

> "On a workload with a catastrophic size outlier, byte-level eviction metrics
> are dominated by whether the outlier object's Zipf rank is high enough to
> keep it resident. We report both object miss-ratio (policy-sensitive, low
> variance) and byte miss-ratio (policy-insensitive at this scale, high
> variance), and flag the difference as a feature of heavy-tailed workloads."

This is a useful warning for practitioners: byte-miss benchmarks on traces with
long tails can be misleading unless you report CI bands.

## Why Small-Cache Favors W-TinyLFU Even More Than Large-Cache

Small Cache regime (cache_frac=0.001) gaps vs LRU:

| Workload | W-TinyLFU vs LRU gap |
|----------|----------------------|
| Congress | 9.4pp (0.869 vs 0.963) |
| Court    | 12.9pp (0.831 vs 0.960) |

OHW Regime (cache_frac=0.01) gaps vs LRU:

| Workload | W-TinyLFU vs LRU gap |
|----------|----------------------|
| Congress | 11.7pp (0.712 vs 0.829) |
| Court    | 11.9pp (0.728 vs 0.847) |

**The smaller the cache, the more admission filtering matters** — because with
only ~10-20 objects resident, one bad admission destroys ~5-10% of cache
capacity. TinyLFU's filter prevents exactly this. With a larger cache, the
filter's value decays because you can afford to keep more marginal keys.

This is the "admission matters under pressure" story — consistent with the
TinyLFU paper and Caffeine production reports.

---

## Court Has Much Higher Variance Than Congress — And Why That Matters

Seed-to-seed variance at cache_frac=0.01:

| Policy      | Congress σ | Court σ | Court/Congress ratio |
|-------------|------------|---------|----------------------|
| W-TinyLFU   | 0.007      | 0.045   | 6.0×                 |
| SIEVE       | 0.006      | 0.045   | 7.5×                 |
| LRU         | 0.002      | 0.026   | 11.0×                |

### Mechanism

Court's raw trace has *real* locality structure: same document requested
multiple times in quick succession (user reading a judicial opinion, refreshing
a docket during active litigation). Replay-Zipf doesn't erase this — it
multiplies a Zipf popularity overlay onto the existing inter-request-interval
pattern.

Different seeds permute which keys get high Zipf rank, but the raw trace's
clumpy access patterns remain. The interaction of raw-clumpiness × Zipf-rank
is highly seed-sensitive: a seed that puts a clumpy key at rank-1 produces a
very different trace than one that puts a smooth key at rank-1.

Congress's raw trace has nearly no such structure (α_raw=0.23, 91.7% unique).
Replay-Zipf essentially *creates* the trace's temporal locality. Seed choice
mostly shuffles the key identities — the popularity shape is preserved.

### The paper claim

> "Multi-seed CI bands are essential for heavy-tailed real-world workloads, not
> just a matter of statistical rigor. A single-seed run on Court could report a
> miss-ratio 10pp off from the true mean. On Congress a single seed is within
> 1-2pp of the mean."

This motivates the 5-seed requirement and validates the Welch's t-test
discipline: our Congress W-TinyLFU vs LRU p-value is 1e-7 (tiny effect × tiny
variance × large effect size); our Court W-TinyLFU vs LRU p-value at α=1.2 is
0.06 (not significant, even though effect size is 8pp) because Court variance
is so high.

---

## The "Policies Are Robust Across Workloads" Meta-Finding

**Policy orderings are almost identical across Congress and Court:**

Congress ordering at cache_frac=0.01 (best → worst):
`W-TinyLFU ≈ SIEVE > S3-FIFO > CLOCK > LRU > FIFO`

Court ordering at cache_frac=0.01 (best → worst):
`W-TinyLFU > SIEVE > S3-FIFO > CLOCK > LRU > FIFO`

**The only swap is W-TinyLFU ↔ SIEVE** (tied on Congress, separated on Court).
All other pairwise orderings are identical on both workloads.

### Why this is a finding, not a non-finding

The midpoint professor feedback specifically flagged the risk that Congress and
Court might produce similar policy rankings, making the writeup dull. Our data
shows the rankings ARE similar — but the *mechanism* behind the rankings is
different on each workload, and the *magnitudes* of the gaps differ
consistently. That's the interesting story: policy choice is robust, but the
workload characteristics change how much each policy's design choice matters.

---

## What's Missing / Caveats

1. **Court single-seed `results/court/mrc.csv` has only 2 policies** (W-TinyLFU
   + W-TinyLFU+DK) because that file was last written by the Phase 4
   Doorkeeper-ablation run, not a full 6-policy sweep. The Mixed Sizes regime
   winner (Court W-TinyLFU byte-MRC=0.284) is correct but the *comparison* is
   not — we only compared W-TinyLFU vs W-TinyLFU+DK at byte level on Court's
   canonical file. **Fix before writeup:** re-run `make run-sweep WORKLOAD=court
   TRACE=traces/court_trace.csv` to refresh `results/court/mrc.csv` with all 6
   policies + byte_miss_ratio, OR use the 5-seed multiseed data's byte_miss_ratio
   column for a proper 5-seed comparison (already captured in the per-seed CSVs
   but not aggregated by Plan 05-04).

2. **α grid stops at 1.2.** Extending to α ∈ {1.3, 1.4, 1.5} would test the
   SIEVE-vs-W-TinyLFU crossover hypothesis above. Cheap to add: one new bash
   invocation per workload, ~60 seconds wall-clock.

3. **No size-aware eviction in any policy.** All our policies are byte-bounded
   but evict at the object granularity. A size-aware variant (GDSF, LRV) would
   behave very differently on Court's long-tail sizes. Already deferred to v2
   per PROJECT.md "Out of Scope".

4. **Code review WR-01 (latent coupling):** plot_results.py winner-bar does not
   filter to BASE_POLICIES; the markdown/json tables do. Today this doesn't
   diverge (sweep is 6-policy default). Flagged for Phase 6 fix.

5. **Code review WR-02 (regime dispatch safety):** plot_results.py if/elif chain
   has no else. Latent, not currently triggered. Flagged for Phase 6 fix.

## Paper Outline Implications

The analysis above maps to paper sections as follows:

- **Workload Characterization** (paper §3): Use the workload_characterization.md
  table verbatim. Add the α_raw / OHW / size-distribution narrative from this
  document's "Workload Characterization" section.

- **Policy Comparison** (paper §4): Lead with compare_mrc_2panel.pdf (the
  canonical 2-panel figure with ±1σ bands). Supplement with compare_policy_delta
  + compare_mrc_overlay. Narrative from "Why W-TinyLFU Wins 11/12 MRC Cells"
  section.

- **Why SIEVE Ties W-TinyLFU on Congress** (paper §5, the interesting finding
  the professor explicitly asked for): Full "Why SIEVE Ties W-TinyLFU" section
  as written here. This is the mechanism-explaining part of the paper.

- **Heavy-Tailed Byte-MRC Warning** (paper §6 or appendix): Full "Why Court's
  Byte-Miss-Ratio Has σ=0.21" section — a methodological warning for other
  practitioners working with long-tailed workloads.

- **Practitioner Decision Tree** (paper §7, conclusion): Use winner_per_regime.md
  as the anchor. For each regime row, add 1 sentence of *mechanism* from this
  document explaining *why* that policy wins that regime.
